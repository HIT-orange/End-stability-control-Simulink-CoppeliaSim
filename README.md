# End-stability-control-Simulink-CoppeliaSim
Simulink model and CoppeliaSim model of ”Stability Control for End Effector of Mobile Manipulator in Uneven Terrain Based on Active Disturbance Rejection Control”
[TOC]
## Code to help calculate kinematic and dynamic equations for manupulator
`kinematic and dynamic model caculation.m`
We write the code based on the Robotics Toolbox in matlab by Peter Corke<https://petercorke.com/toolboxes/robotics-toolbox/>.

 The calculation algorithm of kinematics and dynamics equation is refer to 
 Niku, S.B. (2020), Introduction to robotics: analysis, control, applications, John Wiley & Sons, Weinheim.

## CoppeliaSim scene model
The size of the model is over the upload limit size 25M of Github. So you can download it in the other website<https://download.csdn.net/download/weixin_43658047/15086502>
